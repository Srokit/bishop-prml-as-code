Christopher Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning has really
valuable information on Machine Learning Theory and Math, but is lacking
in practical coding examples.

Software Engineers will stuggle to grasp the relevance of the equations
in the book without code to follow.

Therefore, we created this repo to hold examples from each section of the
book which will make the equations and theories more tangible.
